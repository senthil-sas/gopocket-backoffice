            An eMandate allows you to schedule automatic fund transfers from your bank account to your trading account for your investments in stocks, ETF SIPs, etc. You have to register an eMandate with your bank before you can debit funds. This is a one-time process.
            It may take up to 5 days for your bank to activate / delete the mandate.
            You will have to set up a separate mandate for mutual funds.
